# Generative Art and Computational Creativity

This program provides an in-depth overview of the history and practice of applying generative systems to creative tasks. Below is a comprehensive outline of what the course entails, along with exercises and homework assignments.

## Program Description

This program delves into the world of generative art and computational creativity, offering students a robust understanding of these concepts. You will explore various algorithm families from artificial intelligence, machine learning, and artificial life, all of which have been pivotal in generative processes. 

The course material is enriched with numerous examples from past and contemporary creative practices, encompassing:

- **Visual Art**
- **Music**
- **Poetry and Literature**
- **Performing Arts**
- **Design and Architecture**
- **Games**
- **Bioart**
- **Robotic Art**

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this program, you will:

- Understand the fundamentals of generative art and computational creativity.
- Gain knowledge of key algorithms used in generative processes.
- Apply these algorithms practically to create new generative pieces using the graphical programming language Max.
- Engage in philosophical and societal debates on the automation of creative tasks.

## Course Components

### Lectures

The lectures will cover:
- Definitions and history of generative art and computational creativity.
- Detailed exploration of AI, machine learning, and artificial life algorithms.
- Case studies from various creative fields.

### Practical Exercises

You will engage in hands-on exercises using Max to implement algorithms and create generative art. Each exercise will build on the concepts discussed in lectures.

### Homework Assignments

Homework will include:
- Developing original generative pieces.
- Critical analysis of existing generative works.
